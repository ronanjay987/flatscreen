						<h2> Screen Size and Resolution</h2>
						<p>Screen size, measured diagonally in inches, dictates the TV's physical size. Consider your
							room size and viewing distance when choosing a screen size. <br> <br>
							Resolution, referring to the number of pixels on the screen, directly impacts image clarity
							and sharpness. Common resolutions include Full HD (1080p), 4K (2160p), and 8K (4320p), with
							higher resolutions offering greater detail.</p>
						<h2>Display Technology</h2>
						<p> LED (Light-Emitting Diode): A popular technology that uses LEDs to illuminate the backlight.
							LED TVs offer good picture quality, energy efficiency, and affordability.<br> <br>
							QLED (Quantum Dot LED): An advanced LED technology using quantum dots to enhance color
							accuracy and brightness. QLED TVs deliver wider color gamuts and better HDR performance than
							standard LED TVs.<br> <br>
							OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode): Uses organic materials that emit their own light,
							resulting in perfect blacks, infinite contrast ratios, and wider viewing angles. OLED TVs
							offer exceptional picture quality but are typically more expensive.
						</p>
						<h2>Contrast Ratio and HDR</h2>
						<p>Contrast Ratio: Measures the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of an image.
							A higher contrast ratio indicates better detail in both dark and bright areas, resulting in
							a more realistic picture. <br> <br>
							HDR (High Dynamic Range): A technology that expands the range of colors and brightness
							levels a TV can display, creating more realistic and vibrant images. HDR TVs offer a wider
							dynamic range, with more detail in highlights and shadows.</p>
